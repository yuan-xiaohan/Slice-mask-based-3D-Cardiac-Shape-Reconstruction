## Introduction
An accurate 3D ventricular model is essential for diagnosing and analyzing cardiovascular disease. It is challenging to obtain accurate patient-specific models on scarce data via widely accepted deep-learning methods. 

In this paper, To fully use the characteristics of medical volume-based images, we present a slice-mask representation to better regress the parameters of the 3D model. A data synthesis strategy is proposed to alleviate the lack of training data by sampling in the constructed statistical shape model space and obtaining the corresponding slice-masks. We train the end-to-end structure by combining the segmentation and parametric regression modules. 

## Dataset
we establish a left ventricular CT dataset of a healthy population. It consists of input images after view-planning and corresponding segmentation masks, as well as 3D models. The download link is coming soon.

## Usage
Coming soon.
